## Description
This application will check words to see if they are anagrams, sharing all the same letters, or antigrams, having no common letters.
* * *

## Technologies
* Ruby 2.6.5
* Bundler 1.17.2
* Rspec 3.10
* pry 0.14.0
* git 2.30.1
* GitHub
* * *

## Installation and Setup
* `Ruby 2.6.5` and `Bundler` are **_required applications_** to run this program.  
  * How to [install `Ruby 2.6.5`](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/getting-started-with-ruby/installing-ruby).
  * Once `Ruby` is installed, `Bundler` can be installed by running
  ```bash
  $ gem install bundler
  ```

* **Clone the repository** to a local directory using the command-line tool `git` ([how to install git](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/git-and-github)).  
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/<directory>/<path>/<of>/<choice>/`
  $ git clone https://github.com/MicahOlson/anagrams.git`
  ```

* **Navigate into the project** using `cd` to move to the top level of the project directory.  
  ```bash
  $ cd anagrams/
  ``` 

* **Install all application dependencies** using `Bundler`. This will install all packages (also known as *Gems*) listed in the project's `Gemfile `.
  ```bash
  $ bundle install
  ```

## Testing
* This project was created using **test-driven development** (TDD).

* To **see the test suite**, use `cat` to view the content of this project's spec file.
  ```bash
  $ cat spec/anagrams_spec.rb
  ```

* To **run the test suite** yourself and verify program functionality use `RSpec`, one of the *Gems* installed by `Bundler`.
  ```bash
  $ rspec
  ```

* **Recommended code editors** if you prefer to utilize a *graphic user interface* (GUI) for opening or editing this project's files:
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - "Code editing. Redefined."
  * [Atom](https://atom.io) - "A hackable text editor for the 21st Century"
